    // Supabase's `verifyOtp` or `updateUser` with `access_token` handles this.

    // For a password reset, Supabase's `updateUser` method is used after a successful token verification.
    // The `resetPasswordForEmail` sends a link with `type=recovery` and an `access_token`.
    // The client-side `reset-password/page.tsx` will use this `access_token` to update the password.
    // This API route is more for a custom backend flow, but if the client sends the token,
    // we can use it to update the user's password directly.

        // For this API route, we're assuming it's passed in the body.
        // If this API route is called directly, you'd need to ensure the token is valid.
        // A more common pattern is for the client-side `reset-password/page.tsx` to handle this directly
        // using the `createSupabaseBrowserClient` and the `access_token` from the URL.
        // This API route might be redundant if the client handles it.
        // However, if you want a server-side password reset, you'd need to verify the token first.
        // For simplicity, we're directly using `updateUser` which implicitly uses the session token
        // if the user is already signed in, or the provided access_token if it's a recovery flow.
        // The `reset-password/page.tsx` will handle the token from the URL.
