# EV Charger Security Solution

## Overview

This repository contains a security solution prototype for Electric Vehicle (EV) chargers, focusing on secure communication and protection against cyber threats. The project aims to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, malware injections, and unauthorized access by implementing enhanced authentication and secure data transfer protocols.

## Key Features

- 🔐 Secure communication between EV and charger  
- 🚨 Basic anomaly detection and alert mechanism  
- 🔒 Lightweight encryption protocol implementation  
- 📊 Real-time log monitoring for suspicious activities  
- ⚙️ Designed for microcontroller-based setups (ESP32 / Raspberry Pi Pico W)

## Deployment
